        <h2>Story:</h2>
        <p>
          @maverickdev1 started this project a couple of days ago. It had an established team with 4 people in it, and they even made websites (which you have probably seen here)! People were already saying it was fake, but as stupid as I was, I continued to believe it was real. <br><br>
          I got the "Moderator" rank on his Discord server, c0met14. I also got another role with every permission, including "Administrator"! I helped him with making a rules channel and banning raiders, annoying people and you guessed it, people who said it was fake. <br><br>
          At 25th of February, maverickdev1's Github and Twitter got deleted. His Discord account pinged random people in the c0met developer server, and left the main server. This made me the "Server Owner", because I was the only person with the "Administrator" permission on the server. We all thought he got hacked, but that was probably his way of leaving the project. <br><br>
          When I opened the "general" chat in the Discord, I got harassed for thinking it was real. This made me want to leave the server. But other people were saying I should use my permissions to make the server into a jailbreak community. <br><br>
          So that is exactly what I did. 25th of February, "The Jailbreak Hub" was (re?)born. The Jailbreak Hub is the server where we post REAL jailbreak news, people can share their tweaks, and where we make a community.<br><br> We are terribly sorry for the people who donated money and time to this project, just for it to be fake. <a href="https://github.com/BluDood/bludood.github.io/releases">Here is the last compiled IPA.</a>
